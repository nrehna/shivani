Fresh flowers have the magical ability to instantly brighten a mood.<br> Science says so. Whether you've got Valentine's (or Galentine's Day) presents, an anniversary, or a gift for your BFF's birthday on your mind, sending a gorgeous bouquet is an easy way to remind friends and family you care, even from afar.<br> But, we've all been there. <br>The lucky recipient texts you a photo to thank you and you realize their flowers don't at all resemble the peonies you picked out. So, we curated a list of highly-reviewed nationwide flower delivery services that ship handpicked blooms straight to your loved one's door.<br> Some sites specialize in rustic arrangements (think: Urban Stems and Farmgirl Flowers), others guarantee same-day arrival, and a few—like FTD—offer slightly cheaper options that'll delight, no matter the occasion.<br>
